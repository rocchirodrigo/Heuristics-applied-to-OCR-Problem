# Optimal Coordination of OCRs
Tabu Search is developed in order to find the optimal Plug Setting and Dial values for a given set of OCRs. You need to provide the right primary-backup pairs, short current values and RTC for all relays of the system.
 
PL Tester solves the problem using only Linear Programming (LP), it works for coordination but gives non-optimal results; instead Tabu Search Algorithm found the best results on the literature (dec 2019). Not suited for Real-Time systems.

# Test Systems: 
systems with 3/8/15 buses are meshed and Systems I and II are Radial.
